# Short URL Website

This is a simple web application that allows you to create short URLs. It's built using Python and PostgreSQL.


## Getting Started

1. Set up a PostgreSQL database:
   - Install PostgreSQL on your machine.
   - Create a new database and a table to store the shortened URLs.
   - In this example, we'll call the database "url_shortener" and the table "urls". The table will have three columns: "id" (integer, primary key), "short_url" (text), and "long_url" (text).

2. Set up the backend using Python:
   - Install Flask, a Python web framework, and the psycopg2 library, which allows you to interact with PostgreSQL from Python.
   - Create a new Flask app and define two routes: one for the home page and one for the form submission.
   - In the form submission route, generate a unique short URL and store it along with the submitted long URL in the PostgreSQL database.
   - Return the short URL to the user in the form of a clickable link.


### Deploy code on Heroku,

- Create a Heroku account if you don't already have one.
- Install the Heroku CLI on your local machine.
- Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
- Create a new Heroku app using the following command:
```
heroku create <app-name>
```
Replace <app-name> with the name you want to give your app.

- Add PostgreSQL add-on to your Heroku app using the following command:
   
```
heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```
 
- Update the DATABASE_URL environment variable in your Heroku app settings with your PostgreSQL database URL, which can be found on the Heroku dashboard.
- Install the necessary dependencies for your Flask app using a requirements.txt file:
   
```
   pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

- Commit all changes to your Git repository and push the code to Heroku using the following command:
```
git push heroku master
```
 
- Once the deployment is complete, you can open your app using the following command:
```
heroku open
```

- This will open your app in the default browser.
   
   
   
### deploy your advance URL shortener code on a VPS,
   
 -  Choose a VPS provider: You can choose any VPS provider like DigitalOcean, Linode, Vultr, or Amazon AWS, depending on your requirements.

 -  Set up a server: After choosing a provider, create a server instance with your preferred operating system (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc.).

 -  Install dependencies: Install the necessary dependencies like Python, PostgreSQL, Nginx, and Gunicorn.

 -  Clone the repository: Clone the repository that contains your URL shortener code to the server.

 -  Set up the environment: Create an environment file (.env) and set up your PostgreSQL database details and other necessary environment variables.

 -  Install Python dependencies: Install the required Python packages using pip or pipenv.

 -  Set up the database: Create the required tables and indexes in your PostgreSQL database using the provided migration scripts.

 -  Test the application: Run the application locally and test its functionality.

 -  Configure Nginx: Configure Nginx to act as a reverse proxy and serve the application.

 -  Start the application: Use Gunicorn to start the application and make it available on the specified port.

 -  Configure firewall: Open the necessary ports on the server firewall (usually 80 and 443 for HTTPS).
